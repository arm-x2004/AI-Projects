# 🤖 Master AI & Technical Hobby Lab

Welcome to my centralized hub for independent experiments in Artificial Intelligence, mathematical simulations, and web-based tools. This repository serves as a "monorepo" where I document my technical growth and hobby projects outside of my professional Android development work.

## 🚀 Purpose of this Repo
The goal of this repository is to practice **Clean Architecture** by organizing diverse projects into modular folders. Each project is self-contained with its own logic, styles, and documentation.

## 🛠️ Global Tech Stack
* **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3.
* **Math & Physics:** Lagrange Interpolation, Error Correction.
* **Tools:** GitHub Pages (Deployment), Git (Version Control).
